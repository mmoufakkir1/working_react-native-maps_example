#  working react-native-maps example

This is a fork for the react-native-maps project https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps

React Native Map example components for iOS + Android

Note:
I put some work on this to get all the example errors working out, once downloaded and packages were installed

Then add the AirGoogleMaps directory:

https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps/blob/1e71a21f39e7b88554852951f773c731c94680c9/docs/installation.md#ios

An unofficial step-by-step guide is also available at https://gist.github.com/heron2014/e60fa003e9b117ce80d56bb1d5bfe9e0

## Examples

To run examples:

```bash
npm i
npm start

#Android
